This is the README for our C compiler implemented in Python

The source language as specified is C and the platform for running the file is intel X86.
We have implemented a standalone lexer and parser for running the codes.
The instructions for running the standalone lexer in the home directory of the parser is 

./src/lexer

For running the parser, the command is

./src/parser <input file name>

The output produced will be in the file ParseTree.png. To produce output in user defined file name, the command is

./parser -o <output file name> <input file name

We have also implemented some flags like -o -help -v

Libraries used 
1. ply
2. pydot
